# Drone-Propeller-CFD-Analysis-and-Design-Project

## Project Overview

This project involves the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis and design optimization of a drone propeller. The goal is to enhance propeller efficiency and create a lightweight, functional prototype. The project utilizes ANSYS for CFD analysis and SolidWorks for design and modeling.

## Project Components

1. **CFD Analysis**: Performed using ANSYS to optimize the aerodynamic performance of the drone propeller.
2. **Propeller Design**: Designed in SolidWorks to achieve improved efficiency and reduced weight.
3. **Prototype Development**: Created a functional prototype based on the optimized design.

## Files and Directories

- `ANSYS_Analysis/`: Contains CFD simulation files and results from ANSYS.
- `SolidWorks_Design/`: Contains SolidWorks files (.sldprt, .sldasm) for the drone propeller design.
- `Prototype/`: Documentation and images of the functional prototype.
- `Documentation/`: Includes analysis reports, design notes, and optimization details.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **ANSYS**: For conducting CFD analysis. Ensure you have a compatible version installed.
- **SolidWorks**: For designing the drone propeller. Ensure you have SolidWorks installed.
- **MATLAB/Simulink**: (Optional) For additional analysis and simulations, if applicable.

### How to Run CFD Analysis

1. Open ANSYS Workbench.
2. Import the propeller geometry from the SolidWorks design files.
3. Set up the CFD simulation parameters:
   - Define boundary conditions.
   - Select appropriate turbulence models.
4. Run the simulation and analyze the results.
5. Adjust design parameters based on simulation results to optimize performance.

### How to View the Design

1. Open SolidWorks.
2. Load the propeller design files from the `SolidWorks_Design/` directory.
3. Use SolidWorks tools to view and modify the design as needed.

### Prototype Development

1. Refer to the `Prototype/` directory for images and documentation.
2. Follow the assembly instructions provided to build the prototype.
3. Test the prototype and document any performance observations.
